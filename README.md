# urop_projects
Supervised UROP projects @ MIT.

## 2023

### Scope
The student(s) will contribute to a key measurement of $B_c^+$ semileptonic decays at LHCb focusing on the topic of single-particle mis-identification (misID). The goal of the projects is the development of a gold-standard method of modelling this background in a data-driven way, exploiting calibration samples. An LHCb internal note is planned for this work; there is potential for publication. 

### Technical skills

The student(s) will acquire knowledge primarily on the topics of a) event selection and b) statistical frequentist inference.
